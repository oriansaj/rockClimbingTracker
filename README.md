# Rock Climbing Tracker

The Rock Climbing Tracker is a tool to help climbers keep better track of their progress through routes and potentially keep notes on routes.

One huge draw of rock climbing is the tangible progress you make over time.  The completion of routes is extremely satisfying, and our goal is to heighten that feeling, and make it easier to keep track of progress when completing a route.

Rock climbing tracker allows users to enter routes into the app, along with pertinent info like difficulty, route name, and location, with any notes the user may have on the route.  This way,  the user can look back at the routes they have completed and some cool statistics to go with it, as well as being able to look at their notes from their progress on a challenging route they haven't completed.
